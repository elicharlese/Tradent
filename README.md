## Wave Pro

Welcome to the Wave Pro repo. This is the private repo for Wave Issues, Support, and Discussions. This repo is only available to [DevDojo Pro Subscribers](https://devdojo.com/pro).

## ðŸ“œ Guidelines

When submitting an issue or creating a new discussion please be as descriptive as possible (include a screenshot or a screencast). The better you explain your issue or recommendation the quicker we can all work together to improve or implement features.

## âœ… Do

We're all at different areas on our journey of web development and application creation. Remember how impactful someone else was in your early days. This mentor was probably humble, kind, and helpful. Be that person.

## ðŸ™… Don't Do

 Do not treat anyone in a demeaning or disrespectful way; otherwise you will get booted and your account suspended.

## ðŸ™‰ Profanity

Profanity is allowed, as long as it's not directed at someone. Here are some example of what **you can do**:

"Awe man, this is fuck'n awesome"
"Holy shit, I had no idea it worked that way"
"That is so badass!"

These are all ok, but the following is **never EVER ok**:

"You're a fucking idiot"
"That's some shitty code you wrote"

You get the point, right ðŸ˜‰ If it's used at someone, not cool, otherwise, feel free to swear away.

## ðŸŽ¢ Have Fun

Remember to have fun, because if you're planning on turning your SAAS into a real business this could be something you're working on for the rest of your life. So, remember to take a break from time-to-time, don't stress out, and have some fun building your application.
